# Graphics-Output-Device

Project description:

The creation of a microprocessor (such as ARM, AVR, PIC, etc.)  controlled device capable of reading image files from a connected digital storage medium (such as SD card, Micro-SD card, Compact flash card, etc.) commonly implemented in digital cameras. The device should also allow, through a graphical user interface, the user to select and output specific image files to a monitor via a display interface (such as VGA, HDMI, Composite Video, etc). 

Project Objectives: 

- The device will be capable of reading image files from a digital storage medium commonly implemented in digital cameras. 
- The device will be able to output image files stored on the storage medium, through a standard display interface (such as VGA, HDMI, Composite Video, etc). 
- The device will incorporate graphical user interface software, allowing through user interaction, the navigation and selection of the image files on the storage medium. 
- The device will be portable and will not require an external power supply for operation.
